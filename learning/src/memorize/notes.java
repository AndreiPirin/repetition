Object oriented: Object (Data, Behaviour) - reduced complexity, easier maintenance, code reuse, faster development
Functional: Data | Behavior

Types of programming languages (ways or styles of writing code):
Procedural. Functional. Object-oriented. Event-driven. Logic. Aspect-oriented.

OOP is better for games and user interfaces. Functional programming is better for apps that require a high level of reliability.


In Python a function can exist outside of a class.
But in Java it is always inside a class and that is why we call it a method.

Using a coma we can declare several variables on the same line.

When we declare a simple type, we don’t need to allocate memory.
We use ‘new’ operator to allocate memory to a variable.

Primitive types don’t have members. Reference types do.

We use primitive types for storing simple values, we use reference types for storing complex objects.

In Java, Strings are immutable, unchangeable.

Unnecessary {} braces in the if else / else part of the if statement.

Use for loops when you know how many times you want to repeat something.
Use while loops when you don’t know how many times you want to repeat something.
(Do while loops are rarely used, but we should be aware of them nonetheless.)

To be safe (avoid a null value) we can initialize any String to an empty text like this: “”
This will help avoid NullPointerException error.

JVM ( Heap Space ( New Space | Old Space) )

We use Constructors to initialize our objects. If we don’t create one, Java Compiler will automatically
create a default Constructor with and initialize all fields to their default values: 0, null, false.

Static methods/attributes can be accessed inside a class without creating an object of that class.
We use static fields when a value is independent of objects and we want to share it across all objects.
Static methods can only see other static methods in a class.

in Java, a Class cannot have multiple parents, but an Interface can

Class is about “How”, Interface is about “What”.

Avoid static methods in Interfaces.

import java.lang* - is done by default, implicitly

Local variables don’t have a default value. A value must be assigned manually.

Both static and non-static methods can be used in a non-static method.
In a static method you cannot use a non-static method.

.this keyword can’t be used to address variables and methods inside a static method, or when applying a static value to a variable.

In a Java file there can be only one public class (or zero).
File name must be the same as one of the classes in the file.
Classes are executable only when they have ‘main’ method.
Any class in Java is a data type. ‘BankAccount’ is a (reference) data type.

'this' statement must always be the first statement inside the constructor.

Constructor inside a constructor, possible with keyword this.
