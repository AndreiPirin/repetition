Class - is blueprint for objects, a container for one or more related functions.
Object - is an instance of a class.
Method - is a function that is part of a class. Method always has return type,  Method can be named in any way we want;
Constructor - is a special method that is used to initialize (build) objects. Constructor never has return type. Constructor type must have name of its Class.
String - is a sequence of characters.
Constant - is an entity that cannot be changed once assigned. Use keyword 'final'.

Parameters - variables that are defined when the function is declared. - int summa (int a, int b, int c) < three parameters
Arguments - values that are declared within a function when the function is called. - t.summa (5, 10, 15) < three arguments

Stack - primitive datatypes and references - static memory allocation (temporary / local), variables are accessible directly, so it is faster; memory allocation happens at compilation
Heap - objects - dynamic memory allocation, accessing objects takes more time; memory allocation happens at runtime

Garbage collection - is an algorithm running in the background in Java, which keeps freeing up the memory at regular intervals.
LIFO - Last In First Out -
FIFO - First In First Out - garbage collection mechanism used in Old Space.

Implicit type casting - is done internally by java compiler. No need for any operator.
Explicit type casting - is done by the programmer. Cast operator is needed.

Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings to form a new string
by subsequently appending the next string to the end of the previous strings.
Two strings can be concatenated by using the + or += operator, or through the concat() method.

Unary operators: ++ --

Ternary operator: a ? b : c

Modulus operator: %

Exclusive bitwise or operator ^ (returns true if a single parameter only is true)

Fully qualified name of the class > com.codewithmosh.TextBox

@Override – annotation (a label that we attach to a class member), with this we give extra information to the Java compiler

Inheritance - Every class that we declare in Java automatically inherits methods from other classes.

Encapsulation - in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated
as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class
can access them.

Abstraction – reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details. Like a black box or a TV-remote. We don’t want to know
what’s inside, we just need the outside functionality.

Instance variables - decline inside classes, not inside methods
